# Fashion MNIST Classification with VGG16

This repository implements a deep learning model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 architecture for feature extraction, followed by custom dense layers for classification. The project includes training, evaluation, and visualization of results, including a confusion matrix.
